        Sometimes it's confusing to know your shoe size when you're orderig shoes online. <br>
        I created a code that tells you your EU size if you only know your UK size.<br>
        1)Enter your sex "s-female/v-male" but if you're a kid then enter "b". <br>
        2)Enter your UK shoe size from given sizes <br>
        boom you got an output of your UK size and EU size:)

        Only launguages used for this project are HTML and CSS(just so the code is easier to go over)

        The first code is a small guessing game from 1 to 100.
        The computer tells you if the number is smaller or larger, and how many turns you made. <br>
        The second game is rock paper scissors.
        It asks you to put in rock, paper or scissors and it tells you who won.<br>
        Simple but fun!
